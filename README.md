## Steps with public user authentification
### Get authorization code from browser

- Visit `/oauth?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URL&response_type=code` in your browser.
- You should be redirected to a sign-in page
- After a successful sign-in, you will be redirected to the authorization page which will list all scopes requested by your API client
- Then after accepted, you will be redirected to your API client `redirect_uri` with your `code` in the query string. You can request an access-token now.

### Get access token with authorization code

POST: `/token` with data
